## Getting started

Detailed instructions on how to open and complete the exercises as projects in Eclipse and IntelliJ follow.

### Installing the Java Development Kit (JDK)

The Java Development Kit combines development tools, libraries, the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

As of August 2023 JDK 17 ist the most recent Long-Term-Support (LTS) Version.

#### What is the difference between LTS and Non-LTS versions?

**LTS:** These versions receive long-term support and updates for an extended period.\
**Non-LTS:** These versions are suitable if you want to take advantage of the latest language features and libraries, but they might have a shorter support window.

#### Download

You can download the JDK from the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17">official Oracle website</a> or directly via the following links.
